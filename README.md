A portfolio for GitHub is an online collection or showcase of your work and projects, typically hosted on GitHub Pages or within a repository on GitHub itself. Itâ€™s a great way to demonstrate your skills, showcase your projects, and provide potential employers or collaborators a central place to see your work.
